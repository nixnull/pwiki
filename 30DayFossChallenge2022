# Week 0

[This is a series: [The FOSS Challenge](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) | [Week 0](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek0.html) | [Week 1](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek1.html) | [Week 2](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek2.html) | [Week 3](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek3.html) | [Reflections](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeReflections.html)]

In about one week, I start my own 30 Day FOSS Challenge. Look [here](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) for more information. Today's post is to show where I'm starting from, to set my goals, and to discuss expected pain points.

This is meant to catalog my personal journey with the challenge, yours may look very different. Hopefully you find some of this interesting. If you have any thoughts to share with me, please reach out via mastodon: [@nix@social.stlouist.com](https://social.stlouist.com/@nix).

## Starting Position

I already use Debian Linux for my desktop and laptop, so the majority of my computing is already done on a FOSS platform, tho I do believe I have a proprietary wifi driver running, as well as the official driver for my capture card. There's probably a few other proprietary bits in here, I have not tried to keep it 100% pure.

As far as proprietary software and platforms go, work requires the google suite of tools (namely, Drive, Voice, and Gmail). I will admit I also use Drive for personal usage a lot, so that's going to be a struggle to eliminate. For entertainment I use Reddit as well as many proprietary games. So I'll have to try to keep myself busy a different way.

![a list of apps installed on my phone](../resources/apps.png)

On my phone I recently switched to GrapheneOS, which itself is also all FOSS. I have a handful of proprietary apps installed right now. This includes Todoist and Discord. Both will also be challenges to replace.

## Goals

My goal is to get as close to full 100% FOSS as possible. I'm setting this goal because I'm already in a good position to try it, with a FOSS OS on both my phone and computer, and I think it's really important to dive fully into something and struggle with it to deepen your understanding of it.

Naturally, I cannot avoid the software I need for work, that will be exempted only at work, for work purposes. I will try to avoid them otherwise.

## Expected Problems

The single biggest issue I anticipate having is with entertainment. I'll admit this is not exactly the most crucial issue. But right now a good portion of my entertainment comes from video games and reddit. The solution to this will have to come from a variety of sources, including some open source games (I've had Xonotic recommended to me recently, and always love OpenTTD), reading more, enjoying the Spring weather, and keeping up with my yoga practice. I think it's going to take some active mental reframing to rework these habits.

Another issue is communication. While I already don't rely much on social media, I do rely quite a bit on Discord to communicate with people. I've already made most of my discord connections aware of the challenge and other ways to communicate with me, but I suspect it'll largely mean I'll hear a bit less from those people. I'll likely be trying to connect more with the people I can reach through other means, as well as applying some friendly peer pressure to people to migrate to things like Signal and Mastodon. I'm also considering trying Mattermost or Matrix, which are closer to full replacements of Discord, but I don't have much experience with either one.

Then there's the few apps I have yet to replace. Google Drive is an invaluable tool for me, as I switch between devices frequently and don't like being pinned down to one device, or relying on a synchronization tool. I'm working on setting up a Nextcloud and Collabora, so hopefully that comes together.

Todoist is tricky as well. Besides being my own personal todo dump, I also use it to coordinate household todos with my partner. To truly replace it I need something as convenient for collaboration. Not sure what fills that role yet. (If you have ideas please let me know!)

Finally there's Google Maps. I know my city pretty well luckily, but I do still need maps sometimes. Organic Maps is helpful, but very lacking. It doesn't seem to know where any private addresses are, and also seems to be missing a lot of smaller shops. I know I can (and should) contribute those, but for now it's definitely an incomplete replacement. Also I've noticed the time estimates are really bad. Looks like I'll be leaving "early" to places often for a while.

Anyway, that's my preemptive thoughts. I'm sure I will discover more issues I didn't dream of along the way, but I'm also hopeful there will be as many positive learning experiences as negative, and I'll come out of this consistently using more FOSS than I began with.

If you've read this far, thank you! I'd love to hear from you, especially if you're joining me in the challenge. The more, the merrier!

# Week 1

[This is a series: [The FOSS Challenge](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) | [Week 0](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek0.html) | [Week 1](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek1.html) | [Week 2](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek2.html) | [Week 3](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek3.html) | [Reflections](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeReflections.html)]

One week of April is already gone. I started my [challenge to only use FOSS software](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) at the beginning of this month. Here's what's been going on in that time

## Blog Update

The blog was on Wordpress. Wordpress is a very accessible platform, and is as popular as it is for a reason. However, I have a thing for simplicity, and Wordpress is not simple. I found it frustrating to try to align the theme and appearance to the rest of my website, and I didn't like having to dig through config files or a admin interface to essentially make a primarily text-based communication style work the way I wanted it to. With platforms like WordPress, it feels like you have to either fight against it, or add more extensions and plugins (and therefore more resource usage, more things to keep updated, and more configs and interfaces) to make it do what you want. I'd rather take a simple thing and add what I need to it than wrestle a complex thing into submission.

So I'm replacing WordPress with something very simple that I've written myself. It includes [an rss feed now](https://nullarch.com/blog/rss.xml), which is a wonderful addition. I'll probably post what I've made when I've had a chance to make it presentable, and seen if there's any other features it needs.

The main thing lost is the comments sections. A few people left wonderful comments last week. I appreciate all of your comments. Unfortunately, I do not see comment sections coming back. They require a level of complexity I have no interest in dealing with. Instead of commenting here, consider joining mastodon (if you haven't already) and talking about it there. If you want to find me, I'm [@nix@social.stlouist.com](https://social.stlouist.com/@nix). You can also always email me at nix at nullarch dot com.

## Success

### Shared/Synced Files (Seafile)

This was an interesting journey. My partner and I maintain an extensive photo collection from our adventures, and we've previously synced it with Syncthing. This worked in a technical sense, but it's certainly not intuitive. And as you add more things, and more devices, to syncthing, it gets complicated fast. I still recommend syncthing for certain usages, but I was looking for something more accessible.

First stop was Nextcloud. Nextcloud has a lot of hype in the self-hosting world. It seems to want to do all of the things, file storage, calendar, chat, email, anything you want. It's a highly configurable and extendable platform. There's definitely a lot of fans.

I spent about a week and a half (I started in late March) trying to get it set up in a way I was satisfied with. I learned a lot of cool things in the process, including how to use docker and docker compose. But for most of the time, I had various issues. And when I finally got everything working, I struggled with performance. I was uploading our photos, and Nextcloud would eat up all of the server's ram (and then become unresponsive) when trying to load a page with a lot of thumbnails. Kind of a dealbreaker.

There is probably a fix to the issue I had above. But the whole saga reminded me of exactly why I liked syncthing in the first place: it just worked. I never had to do anything special to get it to work. So I started looking for things a little closer to syncthing.

I came across Seafile. It is more intuitive than syncthing because it uses user accounts instead of configuring by-device. It has a nice web interface, and nice apps. You can even create share links to send things to people who don't have accounts on your server. It does have a few limitations (the mobile app has no sync for some reason) but it is otherwise wonderful. Very pleased with it so far.

## Matrix and IRC - Communication

I'm used to using Discord for my primary communication with friends. Well, a while back I set up bridges between two Discords I am in and corresponding Matrix channels. This means I can message the Discord users via Matrix, and vice versa. Good thing I did that! I've been using Matrix to communicate with people in those Discords. You might consider that to be a bit of a workaround, and that I'm still using Discord. It's a fair critique, but I can claim some success here: two other people have joined me on one of the Matrix servers.

Another server I'm involved with has a bridged irc channel that I've been using. I can't claim to be the first one for that, but it does seem like more people are trying out irc now that there's a couple of us there most of the day. What's old is new again.

## Struggles

Dealing with file synchronization took most of my week, so I haven't made a lot of headway in other places. So this is less struggles, and more things still to do.

* Replacing todoist. I haven't looked into this at all yet. I need something that is easy to use for two people coordinating together. Bob suggested todotxt. I'll give it a look as soon as I can.
* Replacing youtube. I know it's not exactly practical to entirely replace youtube, not without losing access to a lot of amazing creators. But I still have every intention of branching out to find some great content on FOSS platforms, such as PeerTube. Please send me your recommendations.
* Github. williewillus noted on his blog post (linked below) that github is not a FOSS platform, but owned by Microsoft instead. Didn't even think about it. Looks like I have another thing to replace.

## Other Participants

A couple other people have joined the challenge! I'm delighted to see their journeys, and I hope you are too. Here's what I've see so far:

* My good acquantice williewillus has written [a blog post](https://www.vincent-lee.net/blog/2023-03-25-30daysfoss/) about his own journey.
* A fedifriend, F00FC7C8, has also given [a good account of their starting position](https://libranet.de/display/0b6b25a8-6164-28d4-b990-f02895952899) on their friendica page.
* Another fedifriend, Chris Freisen, switched from [chrome to firefox](https://mstdn.ca/@friesen5000/110157970170819855). Love to see another firefox user.
* And kbarker has found a cool [clipboard manager named CopyQ](https://social.vivaldi.net/@kbarker/110124401510246852). This is neat to me because it's a type of software I would've never even thought about.

## Other thoughts

On the previous post (when the blog was on Wordpress) someone commented lamenting that I had decided to exclude my workplace from my challenge. They noted the importance of applying pressure to your workplace to enact larger scale change.

I think this is a great point. I haven't given it as much thought as I should. I do want to elaborate on my particular work situation. I work in education, for a nonprofit that has no IT department. All of our support comes from a third party company. We're very heavily integrated in the Google ecosystem.

For these reasons, I have chosen not to make this a high priority for my challenge this year. But the point is taken, and I will think more about how I might be able to make some headway at work.

As always, suggestions, feedback, even critique is appreciated. Come talk to/yell at me on mastodon.

# Week 2

[This is a series: [The FOSS Challenge](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) | [Week 0](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek0.html) | [Week 1](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek1.html) | [Week 2](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek2.html) | [Week 3](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek3.html) | [Reflections](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeReflections.html)]

This post is a little bit overdue, apologies for that. However, I'm still going strong in my efforts and excited to share what I've been up to.

## Successes

At the beginning of this week I was stuck in a bit of a rut. As I'll mention in the next section, I got stuck trying (and failing) to find youtube alternatives. Then I spent way too long looking for Todoist alternatives. Luckily, that one has a happy ending as you'll see next.

### Todos (Vikunja)

This one has blown me away so far. I did it, I've replaced Todoist. I loved Todoist. My partner and I used it to share a grocery list. I used it to organize all the things I need to do on all of my various projects. I am the kind of person that cannot function without a very organized brain dump, and Todoist was that for me. At one point I even paid for the premium.

I thought for sure I'd find no replacement nearly good enough, or have to use some cobbled together solutions. But I found [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io/). I was pretty hesitant at first, because it's clearly very much still under active development. The app isn't even available in Google Play or F-Droid, you need to grab the .apk directly from their repository.

But to my extremely pleasant surprise, it works amazingly. It does all the things I use todoist for - shared lists, kanbans, repeating tasks with strange periodicity. It even does more that I haven't messed around with (something called a Gantt Chart, for instance). Setting up a docker compose for it was simple thanks to the documents on the website and my previous weeks of experimenting.

The web interface so far seems to run perfectly. The app (at least, the android one) is definitely unpolished and missing some features. Sometimes it's a little quirky. But it works well enough to use daily.

I can't sing this project's praises enough.

### Games (OpenTTD, Xonotic, Pioneers)

This is a sillier portion, but an important one to myself and many other people. We all like to stay entertained. What a better way than finding some FOSS games.

I'm already very familiar with [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/), and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in a chill logistics game. I think it scratches a similar itch to Factorio. I haven't actually been playing it lately, because I played a round of it a couple months ago (as I do about once a year). I just wanted to give it a shout-out here.

What I have been playing recently is [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org/). I grew up in the age of Quake and Unreal Tournament. This is very much a fully realized arena shooter in the same vein as those. It's wonderfully nostalgic. There's enough games going on at any time that I have a few choices of game mode to jump into. The only issue I'm having is that all the active players are way better than me. Please play with me so I have someone who hasn't been playing this every day for years.

Another thing I've played recently is [Pioneers](https://pio.sourceforge.net/), a Catan clone. I don't want to mislead you, I would not put this on the same level as OpenTTD or Xonotic. I would say both those games are as worthy of playing as anything you can find on steam. Pioneers is a little rougher and simpler. It's a full Catan clone, expansions and all, and it's great at that. The devs have obviously put a lot of love into it. But it's not the greatest looking or most friendly UI. I might play this if I'm really looking to play some Catan with distant friends, but otherwise it's more of a novelty for me.

Go play OpenTTD and Xonotic right now. Play them with me sometime.

## Struggles

### Video

I'm going to be super honest here. I don't think I get PeerTube. I think I understand federation, and I love mastodon. But what's going on with PeerTube? It seems like the few major instances that exist are discouraging people from making accounts directly on them unless they're posting videos? Doesn't that hurt discovery, because then the instances aren't federating?

I looked for quite a while for good PeerTube content. And I found some! But it was a struggle, and I had to look very actively. Looking at PeerTube instances was not very helpful, despite that being the obvious place to look. Instead, I ended up going finding a great mastodon account, [Fedi.Video](https://social.growyourown.services/@FediVideo) that links to many. My favorite so far is [Veronica Explains](https://tilvids.com/a/veronicaexplains/video-channels). Originally I intended to post a list, but I just haven't found others I'm as enthusiastic about. Maybe another day.

Please, please, let me know if you know some good PeerTube channels or another good FOSS source of videos.

## What Others Are Up To

Looks like a very android-heavy week for others. If you've got an Android phone, check out the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) store, which lists only FOSS software, including many that aren't on Google Play.

* [F00FC7C8](https://libranet.de/display/0b6b25a8-3564-39e2-73a2-d1b732028184) has done some very thorough Spring Cleaning on Android. 
* [Chris Frisen](https://mstdn.ca/@friesen5000/110217244627953705) installed F-Droid and has been playing a minesweeper clone called Antimine. Nice topical coincidence. He also is getting used to OpenOffice.

## Other Thoughts

I think I'm actually approaching the limit on what I can do on a personal level to use less proprietary things. Outside of work, I'm not using very many proprietary things at all now. My next goal is to look into hosting some services for friends and organizations I'm in, to make it easier for them to use more FOSS. One possibility is setting up Mailman 3 for [Agora](https://agoranomic.org/), which is currently running purely in Mailman 2 mailing lists - 3 also has a web interface, which makes it much more modern and approachable.

# Week 3

[This is a series: [The FOSS Challenge](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) | [Week 0](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek0.html) | [Week 1](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek1.html) | [Week 2](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek2.html) | [Week 3](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek3.html) | [Reflections](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeReflections.html)]

Not much to say at the top this week, so let's jump right in.

## Successes

### Studying (Anki)

This week I've been studying French. I learned a little bit in College, many years ago, and decided to pick it up again. One of the tools I've always relied on for studying is flashcards.

Anki is ridiculously easy to use, and of course FOSS. There's iPhone, Android, Linux, Mac, and Windows versions available, and a synchronization tool on their website. Unlike many FOSS synchronization tools, this one is free and doesn't need you to host anything. Just make an account and go.

Also on the website are many user submitted decks available to use for studing all sorts of things. You can also make your own if you're so inclined. I haven't used it but there also appears to be an addon for importing from Quizlet.

## Struggles

### Installing Linux

I am a long time Linux user and lover. I'm also pretty well versed with computers. I don't remember how I originally learned, or what the struggle was like when I first installed linux on a computer.

But this weekend, my partner decided he wanted to try Linux. He is not a computer person. He knows the software he uses, and he can solve problems with guides and videos. But he's only ever used Windows, and he has no experience with programming or more technical computers things.

So we settled on Linux Mint and got started. At first I wanted to be entirely hands-off and just see what the process was like for him. But it quickly became clear that even with the very nice step-by-step instructions on the Linux Mint website, the hurdles would've stopped him entirely.

He doesn't know what an ISO file is, or what it means to burn it to a USB stick. He doesn't know about the BIOS, or changing the boot options. Or adding something to the secure boot. And those are all the first steps. I ended up walking him through that.

Once we were into the live usb, it was smooth sailing. The only additional input I gave was to help set up LUKS encryption, because he wants it due to the sensitive nature of his work. Everything else was straightforward enough for him to do on his own.

After it was installed I showed him how to update and get new software, and he's taken it from there. Last I heard he was tweaking his desktop theme and toolbars.

This was humbling for me. Linux Mint is what we always tell beginners to try. And once you're in it, it is super beginner friendly! But the documents on the website are not nearly enough for a casual computer user to get it installed. Some might say that's acceptable, but I think we need to do better. In the future I'll be looking for videos and other materials that better guide through (and actually *explain*) those early steps.

If you want to see his version of this same story, take a look at [his mastodon](https://urbanists.social/@rorke/110249953295511836).

### Yoga

I do Yoga at home. It helps me feel relaxed and flexible and feel like I exercised on days that I don't get out enough. I like it quite a bit. Right now I use Down Dog, which does a pretty excellent job of generating a routine based on some parameters (experience, length, type of routine) and then walking you through it with both voice guide and visuals.

I have found nothing that even kind of replaces this in the FOSS world so far. I looked for a bit myself, and asked mastodon. The post got boosted a few times (thanks!) but nobody had answers for me.

Of course, I could use videos instead of software. I also asked if there was anyone doing Yoga routines on PeerTube. Again I couldn't find anything. I'm afraid this is a very specific thing that might be missing from the FOSS world.

If you have any leads on this, let me know!

## What Others Are Up To

This week I asked non-tech people what FOSS software they're using/familiar with. The [thread](https://social.stlouist.com/@nix/110238381835309011) got a lot of great answers. Here's some that stood out to me, and that you might want to use yourself, or mention to others when trying to explain FOSS:

Desktop Apps:

* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (playing videos and music)
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) (word documents and spreadsheets)
* [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (editing images)
* [Krita](https://krita.org/) (painting/creating images)
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (editing audio)
* [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (recording and streaming video)
* [Orca Screen Reader (Linux)](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/) or [NVDA (Windows)](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (accessibility tool)
* [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) (email)

Phone Apps:

* [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) or [OrganicMaps](https://organicmaps.app/) (navigation)
* [Feeder](https://feeder.co/) (rss and atom feeds/keeping updated on websites and news)

There's more in the thread, I couldn't list them all.

## Final Thoughts

This week has me thinking a lot about reaching non-tech people. There's a lot of great FOSS software many are already using. And there's a lot of great software they might be happy to use if properly introduced to it.

But the difficulties need to be minimized as much as possible, either by better designs or better documentation. And a lot more attention needs to be paid to the experiences of absolute beginners, especially those that might be discouraged by the challenges. In a way we there's a survivorship bias. Everyone using a give product made it through the initial hurdles, so we're all going to agree that the process is good enough. We need to figure out the cases where someone wouldn't make it through.

# Week 4

[This is a series: [The FOSS Challenge](https://nullarch.com/30DayFOSSChallenge.html) | [Week 0](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek0.html) | [Week 1](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek1.html) | [Week 2](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek2.html) | [Week 3](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeWeek3.html) | [Reflections](https://nullarch.com/blog/posts/30DayFOSSChallengeReflections.html)]

I finished my 30 Day FOSS challenge at the end of April. I've been thinking about what I want to say about it overall since that time has ended, as well as what I've been up to since then.

First, I'm really glad I did it! I learned a lot, and I got to connect with some very cool people through it. I'm hopeful to expand both this knowledge and these connections in the future.

### What Went Well

I love vikunja. It has fully replaced todoist for me. Very pleased with this change. I've also grown really fond of matrix, and enjoyed using the bridge.

Another big success is just how much server side skill I gained. Learned to use dockers and nginx reverse proxies and certbot.

Also, my partner is using Linux Mint! There's still struggles here and there, but overall it's going well.

### What Didn't Go Well

Collaborative file sharing. I landed on Seafile, but I'm still not fully satisfied. My partner and I have started planning out summer roadtrip and that involves coordinating on some documents. Google Drive made that extremely convenient. Seafile doesn't have synchronous editing. I know Nextcloud does, but I have trouble with getting it working exactly how I wanted, and with performance. And of course, that's not an option for the average person with no server knowledge.

I hesitate to put it in this category, because it does work mostly, but not as well as I wish: mapping and routing. I'm using Organic Maps. It's nice enough, but it lacks specifics for private addresses, and the times are frequently pretty bad. I can cope with this because I'm pretty decent at routing without a map, but I couldn't recommend it to someone that relies on them more.

Videos. I resent that Google has a monopoly on videos right now, but they do. It's an extremely hard sell to cut myself off from fantastic content (especially great video-essays).

### Post-Challenge

Since the challenge ended, I eased up a bit on my self-imposed restrictions. An activist group I'm part of primarily organizes on Discord, so I'm back on that. I also have been playing an excellent solarpunk game called Terra Nil that I bought on Steam.

There's also some apps that I just can't replace for their utility, namely venmo, my credit union's app, and transit. The first two are for sending/receiving money, and the last is for routing on public transit and buying tickets. I can buy tickets with cash, but I don't have easy access to cash on a regular basis due to not having a brick-and-mortar banking location near me. These are just too important to replace right now, and honestly I'm relieved to have them back.

### Next Steps

It took me longer to write this post than I expected, and I think it's because this post is much more negative than I expected. It's just become clear that, outside a handful of great options, FOSS isn't only a downgrade in many cases, but it's also just not feasible for the average person. They don't have the skill set to install linux themselves, and they definitely don't have the skill set to run Nextcloud or Vikunja on a server. And on the topic of self-hosting, there's an undeniable financial investment that's not feasible for everyone.

So how do I go somewhere from there? One option is to set up community events to introduce people to the skills and knowledge they need, and educate them on the importance of FOSS. Another is to host public services for people in my area, and encourage others to do the same. The mastodon instance I'm on is such a service, hosted by [JW](https://social.stlouist.com/@jw). Could such a concept be expanded in a coop or other donation based model, and paired with in-person meetups to educate people?

I've also been thinking about some adjacent issues and how they tie in. Self hosting means spinning up a server (either at home or VPS). That means money but it more specifically means electricity. I've been thinking about network models that reduce or eliminate this need. A couple promising projects in this realm are [Solar Protocol](http://solarprotocol.net/) and [Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/get-started/).

In a more direct simpler way, I've been thinking about how the ethos of degrowth can be applied to these problems. For instance, instead of Google Drive/Nextcloud/Seafile, what about just a usb drive? Anyone can use one of those, and if you're just sharing with people in the same household, it's quite convenient.

### Wrap-Up

I think I leave this challenge with less practical wins and more knowledge and thoughts about which directions to head in. I think it's a good place to be tho, one where I've got much more of an idea of what avenues to explore next.

I'm also definitely planning to revisit this next year. By then I'm sure the FOSS landscape, and my needs, will have shifted slightly. Keeping updated and learning new things will be interesting.

I'm glad I did this, and thank you so much for following along or participating!
